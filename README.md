# Database-Project-MySQL
Modeling a pharmacy database with MySQL using commands of Data Query Language (DQL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), Data Transaction Language (DTL) and concepts of the First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF) and Third Normal Form (3NF).

A pharmacy sells various types of products (medicines, cosmetics, etc.). In addition to the type, for each product there is a code, designation, composition, manufacturer and price. When a customer buys a product for the first time, their data (name, address, phone, zip code, city and Social Security Number) are registered. Once registered, whenever a customer buys a certain product, their customer code is registered, together with the products purchased, the name of the doctor (in the case of prescriptions), as well as the total price of the sale. Every purchase is identified by a number to facilitate consultations in the database.
