# Database-Project-MySQL
The purpose of this project is to model a pharmacy Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER Model) with MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE and do the Normalization using the First Normal Form (1NF), the Second Normal Form (2NF) and the Third Normal Form (3NF). Then manipulate the database with MYSQL using commands of Data Query Language (DQL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), Data Transaction Language (DTL).

The description of the business which the ER model should be based on is the following: A pharmacy sells various types of products (medicines, cosmetics, etc.). In addition to the type, for each product there is a code, designation, composition, manufacturer and price. When a customer buys a product for the first time, their data (name, address, phone, zip code, city and Social Security Number) are registered. Once registered, whenever a customer buys a certain product, their customer code is registered, together with the products purchased, the name of the doctor (in the case of prescriptions), as well as the total price of the sale. Every purchase is identified by a number to facilitate queries in the database.
